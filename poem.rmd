In the shadowed corners of a crowded room,  
I trace the lines of silence, feel the gloom.  
You laugh, your voice a melody that haunts,  
While I stand still, a ghost in muted fonts.  

Your eyes, they sparkle like the evening stars,  
But to you, I’m just a whisper from afar.  
I watch you dance, a flame that lights the night,  
A candle burning, while I fade from sight.  

The world spins on, a carousel of dreams,  
And yet my heart is tangled in your seams.  
I carve your name in whispers on my skin,  
A secret echo where my thoughts begin.  

You speak of love as if it blooms in spring,  
But I remain a wallflower, unseen thing.  
I gather words like petals, soft and sweet,  
Yet when I speak, my heart skips, feels defeat.  

In crowded places, laughter fills the air,  
But in your gaze, I find an empty stare.  
I paint my hopes in colors bold and bright,  
Yet all you see are shadows in the light.  

Perhaps one day you’ll notice from afar,  
The aching heart that longs to be a star.  
But for now, I’ll cherish every sigh,  
A love unspoken, whispered to the sky.  

And as the seasons turn, I’ll hold the space,  
For love unreturned, a bittersweet embrace.  
In every heartbeat, you will always stay,  
A tender ache that never fades away.
